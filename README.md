# Django + Svelte Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through creating a Django and Svelte project (without SvelteKit), serving the Svelte files directly from Django.

It is recommended that you follow the instructions along instead of cloning this repo.

This guide was heavily inspired by other online resources. See below for the credits.

This guide follows what I consider best practices as of september of 2022. It may need to be updated in the future. I may or may not do that.

Needless to say, this is what works for me personally. I am an academic, not a professional developer. I do not provide any guarantees that it has no flaws, nor that it will work for your particular purposes. So, use it at your own risk. Also, it may need to be modified further for use in a production environment.
